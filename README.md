# RachioService #

## Introduction ##

This is the Rachio Plugin for Vera home automation controllers. It provides an integration through
the Rachio public API to allow Vera users to monitor and control their Rachio Iro irrigation systems.

The Rachio Plugin runs on Vera UI7 only. Rachio does not run under openLuup, and has not been tested with
ALTUI (but the author is a big fan of both of these projects, so stay tuned for future developments).
